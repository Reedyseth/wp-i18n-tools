## WP i18n Tools

Modified slightly by WebSharks, Inc.

#### Differences from Original...

- Adding shebang line to the top of `makepot.php`
- Setting executable bit on `makepot.php` and preserving that with Git.
- Updated to support PHP/translations embedded into `.js` files too.
- Disabling line wrapping from final output to ensure better consistency.
